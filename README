OVERVIEW
LarKC is a platform for massive distributed incomplete reasoning that will 
remove the scalability barriers of currently existing reasoning systems for the 
Semantic Web.

The LarKC platform can be configured to run arbitrary pipelines of plugins, and 
can run on a single machine but also on a distributed system such as a grid or 
a cluster. Some plugins are included with this distribution, others may be found 
online.

See http://larkc.eu/ for more information.
