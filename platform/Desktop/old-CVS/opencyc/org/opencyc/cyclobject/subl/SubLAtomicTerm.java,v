/**
 * KB comment for #$SubLAtomicTerm as of 2002/05/07:<p>
 *
 * The collection of all atomic denotational terms in the CycL
 * language that are not explicitly represented in CycL
 * (i.e. they are neither #$CycLConstants nor #$CycLVariables)
 * but are represented in SubL, the underlying implementation
 * language of the Cyc system.  "Atomic" here means not
 * constructable from other terms via the SubL syntax.  Examples
 * include the terms `212', `:NOUN', `#x', and `VARIABLE-P'. Do
 * not confuse this collection with #$SubLAtom, most of whose
 * instances, while they are expressions of SubL, are _not_ part
 * of CycL.  Note that this collection, like most instances of
 * #$CycLExpressionType, is "quoted" (see #$quotedCollection).<p>
