 *
 * The collection of all #$SubLSymbols except #$SubLVariables (qq.v.); a
 * subcollection of #$CycLClosedAtomicTerm.  Note that `symbol' has a very
 * specific, technical meaning in SubL; #$SubLNonVariableSymbols are rarely used
 * in CycL assertions, except within those built with certain
 * #$CycInferenceDescriptorPredicates like #$defnIff. Examples of SubL
 * non-variable symbols include the symbols `GENLS' and
 * `CYC-SYSTEM-NON-VARIABLE-SYMBOL-P'.  Note that this collection, like most
 * instances of #$CycLExpressionType, is "quoted" (see #$quotedCollection).<p>
