 * KB comment for #$SubLCharacter as of 2002/05/07:<p>
 *
 * The collection of all character-denoting terms in the CycL language that are
 * #$SubLAtomicTerms (q.v.). (SubL, which subsumes CycL, is the underlying
 * implementation language of the Cyc system.)  A given #$SubLCharacter
 * CHAR-TERM is itself a string consisting of the hash-symbol (`#'), followed by
 * the backslash (`\'), followed (in most cases) by the character CHAR that
 * CHAR-TERM denotes.  For example, the SubLCharacter `#\A' denotes the
 * character `A'.  (An exception to the above is when CHAR is a non-printing or
 * control character, in which case a specially-designated string appears
 * after the `#\'.)<p>
