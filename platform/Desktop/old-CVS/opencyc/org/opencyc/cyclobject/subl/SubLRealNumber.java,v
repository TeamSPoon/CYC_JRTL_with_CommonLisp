 * KB comment for #$SubLRealNumber as of 2002/05/07:<p>
 *
 * The collection of all number-denoting expressions in the CycL language that
 * are _not_ CycL constants or NATs, but are terms of SubL, the underlying
 * implementation language of the Cyc system. #$SubLRealNumbers are numeric
 * strings of the Arabic decimal system, including the decimal point and
 * scientific notation.  Examples include the terms `212' and `3.14159d0'.
 * Non-examples include the expressions `#$One', `(#$Meter 6)', `(#$Unity 3)',
 * `:34', `#$PlusInfinity', and `Avogadro's number'.  Note that this collection,
 * like most instances of #$CycLExpressionType, is "quoted" (see
 * #$quotedCollection).<p>
