 * KB comment for #$ELVariable as of 2002/05/07:<p>
 *
 * The collection of all #$CycLVariables that are also #$ELExpressions (q.v.).
 * An #$ELVariable is a character string consisting of a question mark `?' (as
 * its initial character) followed by one or more characters, where each of
 * these latter characters is either an (upper- or lower-case) Roman letter, an
 * Arabic numeral (i.e. `0' through `9'), a hyphen (`-'), an underscore (`_'),
 * or another question mark.  (The letters occurring in an EL variable used in
 * an actual assertion will typically be all uppercase; but this convention is
 * not enforced in any formal way.)  Examples: `?WHAT', `?OBJ-TYPE', and
 * `?var0'.  Note that this collection, like most instances of
 * #$CycLExpressionType, is "quoted" (see #$quotedCollection).<p>
