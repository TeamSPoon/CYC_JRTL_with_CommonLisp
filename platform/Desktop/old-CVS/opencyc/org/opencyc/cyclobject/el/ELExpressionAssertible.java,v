 * The collection of syntactically and semantically well-formed #$ELExpressions.
 * Note that the suffix 'Assertible' is meant to connote syntactic and semantic
 * well-formedness only (cf. #$ELSentence-Assertible): an instance of
 * #$ELExpression-Assertible is assertible into the Cyc Knowledge Base (after
 * being converted to HL form by the #$CycCanonicalizer) only if it is also an
 * instance of #$ELSentence-Assertible.<p>
