 * KB comment for #$CycLOpenDenotationalTerm as of 2002/05/07:<p>
 *
 * The collection of all open denotational terms in the CycL language.  An
 * expression is "open" if it contains one or more free variables (see
 * #$CycLOpenExpression).  A CycL term is said to be "denotational" if it is the
 * right sort of term to have a denotation (or value) in the universe of
 * discourse (see #$CycLDenotationalTerm).  Each instance of
 * #$CycLOpenDenotationalTerm is either a #$CycLOpenNonAtomicTerm (i.e. a "NAT"
 * with a free variable) or a #$CycLVariable iself.  Examples include `?X',
 * `(#$JuvenileFn ?X)', and `(#$JuvenileFn #$isa ?X #$genls #$JuvenileFn)' (even
 * though the latter is semantically ill-formed).<p>
