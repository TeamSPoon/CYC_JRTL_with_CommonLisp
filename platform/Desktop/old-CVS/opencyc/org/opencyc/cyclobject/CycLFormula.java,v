 * KB comment for #$CycLFormula as of 2002/05/07:<p>
 *
 * The collection of well-formed non-atomic CycL expressions.  Each instance of
 * #$CycLFormula consists of a CycL expression that denotes a relation (e.g. a
 * #$Predicate, #$Function-Denotational, or #$TruthFunction) -- or at least an
 * expression that could be interpreted as having a relation as its semantic
 * value (see #$CycLGenericRelationFormula) -- followed by one or more CycL
 * terms (see #$CycLTerm), with the entire sequence enclosed in parentheses.
 * For example, (#$isa #$Muffet #$Poodle) and (#$BirthFn #$Muffet) are both CycL
 * formulas.  Two important specializations of #$CycLFormula are
 * #$CycLNonAtomicTerm (whose instances are also called "denotational formulas")
 * and #$CycLSentences (whose instances are also called "logical formulas").
 * (Note that this notion of "formula" differs somewhat from that used in formal
 * logic, where a formula is normally defined as an (atomic or non-atomic,
 * quantificationally closed or open) sentence.)<p>
