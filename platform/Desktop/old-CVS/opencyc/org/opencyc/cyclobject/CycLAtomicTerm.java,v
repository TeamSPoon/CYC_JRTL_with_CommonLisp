 *
 * The collection of all atomic #$CycLDenotationalTerms (q.v.).  "Atomic" here
 * means not constructible from other CycL terms via the syntax of CycL.  Thus,
 * subcollections of #$CycLAtomicTerm include #$CycLConstant, #$CycLVariable,
 * and #$SubLAtomicTerm.  Note that #$CycLAtomicTerm, like most instances of
 * #$CycLExpressionType, is "quoted" (see #$quotedCollection).<p>
