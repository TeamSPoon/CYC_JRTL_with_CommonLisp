 * KB comment for #$CycLSentence as of 2002/05/07:<p>
 *
 * The collection of syntactically well-formed sentences of the CycL language.
 * Each instance of #$CycLSentence consists of a CycL expression denoting a
 * logical relation (i.e. a #$Predicate or #$TruthFunction) followed by one or
 * more CycL terms, with the entire sequence enclosed in parentheses.
 * #$CycLSentences need not obey arity constraints or other semantic constraints
 * (such as argument type constraints). #$CycLSentences are also called "logical
 * formulas", and are to be distinguished from "denotational formulas" (which
 * are also known as "NAT"s; see #$CycLNonAtomicTerms).  Note that this notion
 * of a CycL sentence is broader than the notion of "sentence" standardly used
 * in formal logic, where a sentence is defined as a _closed_ well-formed
 * formula: CycL sentences may be _open_ (i.e. contain free variables).<p>

@Initial check in of CycL objects, an alternative to org.cycobject.* classes, in
those cases where closer alignment to the CycL grammar is required.
