 * KB comment for #$CycLConstant as of 2002/05/07:<p>
 *
 * The collection of all constants in the CycL language. #$CycLConstant has as
 * instances all #$CycLAtomicTerms other than #$CycLVariables and
 * #$SubLAtomicTerms (qq.v.).  Orthographically, CycL constants are those atomic
 * terms (i.e. terms not constructable from other terms via CycL syntax) that
 * are prefixed by "#$" in their printed (as opposed to their HTML-displayed)
 * representations.  For example, `#$Dog' and `#$isa' are CycL constants, while
 * other CycL terms like `?X', `42', and `(#$GovernmentFn #$France)' are not.<p>
