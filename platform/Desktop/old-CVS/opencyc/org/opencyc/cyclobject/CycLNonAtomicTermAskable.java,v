 * KB comment for #$CycLNonAtomicTerm-Askable as of 2002/05/07:<p>
 *
 * The collection of #$CycLNonAtomicTerms that can appear within sentences that
 * are askable as queries to the Cyc system (see #$CycLSentence-Askable).  More
 * precisely, each instance of #$CycLNonAtomicTerm-Askable is a CycL non-atomic
 * term that is constructible via the syntax of CycL without violating any
 * applicable arity constraints (see #$arity).  Note that askable CycL
 * non-atomic terms do not necesarily obey other semantic constraints beyond
 * arity, such as argument-type constraints (see #$ArgTypePredicate); thus they
 * are not always semantically well-formed in the fullest sense
 * (cf. #$CycLNonAtomicTerm-Assertible).<p>

@Initial check in of CycL objects, an alternative to org.cycobject.* classes, in
those cases where closer alignment to the CycL grammar is required.
