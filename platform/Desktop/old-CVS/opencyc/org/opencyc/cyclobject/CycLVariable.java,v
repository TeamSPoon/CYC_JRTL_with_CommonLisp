 * KB comment for #$CycLVariable as of 2002/05/07:<p>
 *
 * The collection of all variables in the CycL language.  A #$CycLVariable is a
 * character string consisting of a question mark `?' (as its initial character)
 * followed by one or more characters, where each of these latter characters is
 * either an (upper- or lower-case) Roman letter, an Arabic numeral (i.e. `0'
 * through `9'), a hyphen (`-'), an underscore (`_'), or another question mark.
 * (The letters occurring in a CycL variable used in an actual assertion will
 * typically be all uppercase; but this convention is not enforced in any formal
 * way.)  Examples: `?WHAT', '?OBJ-TYPE', and `?var0'.<p>
