 * KB comment for #$CycLRepresentedTerm as of 2002/05/07:<p>
 *
 * The collection of all denotational terms that are represented in the CycL
 * language, instead of being defined in SubL, the underlying implementation
 * language used by Cyc.  That is, each instance of #$CycLRepresentedTerm is
 * either (i) an atomic term, and thus also an instance of
 * #$CycLRepresentedAtomicTerm (q.v.), or (ii) a non-atomic term (or "NAT"), and
 * has a #$CycLRepresentedTerm as its arg0 functor (the other arguments in the
 * NAT need not be CycL represented terms).  Thus #$CycLRepresentedTerm has as
 * instances all #$CycLConstants, all #$CycLVariables, and all
 * #$CycLNonAtomicTerms.<p>
