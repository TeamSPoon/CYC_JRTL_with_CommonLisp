 * KB comment for #$CycLPropositionalSentence as of 2002/05/07:<p>
 *
 * The collection of CycL sentences that express propositions (see
 * #$Proposition).  Two necessary (and, arguably, jointly sufficient) conditions
 * for a CycL sentence's expressing a proposition is that it be semantically
 * well-formed (see #$CycLSentence-Assertible) and closed (see
 * #$CycLClosedSentence).<p>
