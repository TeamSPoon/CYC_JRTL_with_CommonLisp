 * KB comment for #$CycLClosedExpression as of 2002/05/07:<p>
 *
 * The collection of #$CycLExpressions that contain no free variables.  (A
 * variable VAR occurs _free_ in an expression EXPR if and only if there is an
 * occurrence of VAR in EXPR that is not bound by a quantifier in EXPR.)  Note
 * that those CycL sentences that are treated (in the context of representing
 * assertions in the Cyc Knowledge Base) as implicitly containing universal
 * quantifiers are _not_ closed expressions (see #$CycLClosedSentence). Also
 * cf. #$CycLOpenExpression.<p>
