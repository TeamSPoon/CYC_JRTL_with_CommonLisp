 * The collection of CycL expressions that contain one or more free variables.
 * A variable VAR occurs _free_ in an expression EXPR if and only if there is an
 * occurrence of VAR in EXPR that is not bound by a term denoting a
 * #$ScopingRelation (q.v.), such as a quantifier or #$TheSetOf, in EXPR.<p>
