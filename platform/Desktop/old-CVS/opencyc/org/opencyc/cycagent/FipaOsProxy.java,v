/**
 * Provides a proxy for a cyc agent on the CoABS grid agent community.<p>
 *
 * An instance of this class is created for each unique cyc agent which makes
 * itself known to the agent manager.  A cyc image can host one or more cyc
 * agents.  Each message envelope from a cyc agent contains a parameter to
 * indicate which agent agent community processes the messge - either the CoABS
 * grid (Darpa & gov) or the FIPA-OS platform (OpenCyc).
