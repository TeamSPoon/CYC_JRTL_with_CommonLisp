/**
 * <P>SubLWorkerSynch is designed to provide a handle for a particular 
 * communication event with a Cyc server in a synchronous manner. 
 * DefaultSubLWorkerSynch provides the default
 * implementation while SubLWorker and DefaultSubLWorker provide
 * asynchronous communications capabilities. Currently, SubLWorkerSynchs are one-shot,
 * i.e., a new SubLWorkerSynch needs to be created for every new communication.
 * SubLWorkerSynchs are cancelable, time-outable and provide means for incremental
 * return results.
 *  
 * <P>Example usage: <pre>
 * try {
 *    CycAccess access = new CycAccess("localhost", 3640);
 *    SubLWorkerSynch worker = new DefaultSubLWorkerSynch("(+ 1 1)", access);
 *    Object work = worker.getWork();
 *    System.out.println("Got worker: " + worker + "\nGot result: " + work + ".");
 *  } catch (Exception e) {
 *    e.printStackTrace();
 *  }
 * </pre>
