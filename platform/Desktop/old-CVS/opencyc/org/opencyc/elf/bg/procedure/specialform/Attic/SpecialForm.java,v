/**
 * <P>
 * SpecialForm is the class which provides the common abstraction for built-in statements
 * which have special handling (non-evaluation) of some or all of their arguments.  Each
 * subclass implements the method that provides its special behavior.  So that behavior
 * is aligned with the Procedure instances, each subclass of special form has a 
 * singleton instance that is its recipie.</p>
