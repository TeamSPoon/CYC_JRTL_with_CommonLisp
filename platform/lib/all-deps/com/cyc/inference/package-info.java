/**
 * Provides the classes specific to working with Cyc inference.
 * 
 * It corresponds roughly to the 
 * Knowledge Management
 *   Queries
 * node in the Cyc Map.  There is some question about whether this package should really be part of the 
 * com.cyc.km package, or whether it really merits a top-level package. The current
 * thinking is that it should comprise a top-level node, as it is one of the main activities that 
 * API users are expected to engage in, and will be accessible to many more users than most
 * of the elements in the Inference node of the map.
