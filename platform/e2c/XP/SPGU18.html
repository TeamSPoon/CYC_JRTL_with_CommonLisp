<title>CS 4344/7344 - Lecture 18 - March 5, 1998</title>
<h1>CS 4344/7344 - Lecture 18</h1>
<h1>Memory-based Understanding</h1><p>
</p><hr>

<h2>What does a plan look like?</h2>

<p>
For any given goal, there may be countless ways to accomplish the goal.
For example, if we read "John is hungry," we might infer a bunch of
different plans that John might follow to satisfy his hunger.  He might
go to his refrigerator and find something to eat.  He might go to 
Kroger and buy something, then take it home and cook it.  He might go
to a restaurant and order something yummy.  He could go out hunting
animals, kill one, and take it home and cook it.  He could roam the
streets, looking in trash cans for something edible.  Or, if he's
really desperate, he could, as illustrated by that Stephen King
short story we talked about in class, cut off his own body parts and 
eat them.  (Chicken a la "King" takes on a whole different meaning now,
doesn't it?).

</p><p>
All these plans share some commonalities.  If we were to decompose 
(oh, sorry, maybe "decompose" isn't the best word to use in light
of that Stephen King story)...If we were to break down 
those plans into smaller components, we'd find that they all contain
most, if not all, of these basic steps:

</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li> find out where the resource (in this case it's food) can be obtained

<p>
</p></li><li> get close to the resource

<p>
</p></li><li> gain control of the resource

<p>
</p></li><li> prepare it in some way 

<p>
</p></li><li> use or consume the resource
</li></ul>

<p>
Some of these components can be viewed as subgoals of the original goal, 
so the steps or actions of a plan can be viewed as being organized 
around these subgoals.  Similar subgoals are found in lots of plans,
so they've been given special names.  The first three subgoals listed 
above are called "delta-goals" or "D-goals":

</p><p>
<b>D-know (X)</b> - acquire knowledge about where to get X (e.g., look in the
phone book, ask someone, refer to memory)

</p><p>
<b>D-prox (X)</b> - change proximity to be nearer to X (e.g., drive, walk,
call a taxi, take MARTA)

</p><p>
<b>D-cont (X)</b> - achieve possession or control of X (e.g., buy it, steal
it)

</p><p>
They involve change (as do all goals) but there may be lots of ways
to make these changes occur.  The next subgoal, depending on the main
goal itself, has, by comparison, relatively few ways of being accomplished.
In the case of food, you cook it or you don't (plus or minus some
presentation details).  It still involves changed, but only specific 
ways of changing are available.  So this subgoal is given a different
name---it's called an "instrumental goal" or "I-goal".  I-goals are very
specific, and are satisfied with scripts (called, not surprisingly,
"instrumental scripts").  The specific I-goal 
we're dealing with here is:

</p><p>
<b>I-prep (X)</b> - make X ready for use (e.g., cut it up, cook it, put salt on
it)

</p><p>
The last thing we see in our more detailed plan above is merely a good
old-fashioned act, but one which actually results in the desired state
and can't be performed until the previous subgoals are satisfied:

</p><p>
<b>Do (X)</b> - use or consume X (e.g., (INGEST (object X)))

</p><p>
</p><h2>The big goals</h2>

<p>
To try to organize knowledge about goals and plans, Schank et al. 
have divided goals into four (maybe five) different types (which
are not unlike Maslow's goal hierarchy, for you psychology fans):

</p><p>
<b>Satisfaction goals</b>:  these come from recurring biological needs, and
have a frequency with which they must be satisfied.  Examples are
S-HUNGER, S-SLEEP, and S-SEX.  When S-goals are frustrated, it
serves as a major source of expectations to an understander.
There are standard goal objects or instruments used for achieving
S-goals (except for S-SLEEP).  If an actor can't find a particular
goal object, he or she will probably substitute another.

</p><p>
<b>Enjoyment goals</b>:  an activity which is optionally pursued for 
enjoyment or relaxation.  Examples are E-TRAVEL, E-ENTERTAINMENT,
E-EXERCISE, and E-COMPETITION.  The primary plan for achieving
E-goals is to go to where the activity takes place.  S-goals
can be pursued as E-goals.

</p><p>
<b>Achievement goals</b>:  the realization, often over a long period of time,
of some valued property or position.  Examples are A-POSSESSION,
A-POWER-POSITION, A-GOOD-JOB, A-SOCIAL-RELATIONSHIP, or A-SKILL.
When A-goals are satisfied, they typically guarantee the future
satisfaction of bundles of S-goals and E-goals.  Higher level goals
are easier to satisfy if you are rich and powerful.

</p><p>
<b>Preservation goals</b>:  preserving or improving the health, safety, or 
good condition of people, property, or position.  Examples are
P-HEALTH, P-SAFETY, P-SOCIAL-POSITION, or P-EYESIGHT.

</p><p>
<b>Crisis goals</b>:  responding to serious and imminent threats to valued
persons or objects.  These may be regarded as a special class of P-goals.
Examples are C-HEALTH or C-FIRE.

</p><p>
</p><h2>Plan-based understanding</h2>

<p>
Now that you know about goals, plans, and scripts, it's time to give
you the (overly simplified) procedure for plan-based understanding:

</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li> Determine the goal

<p>
</p></li><li> Determine the D-goals and I-goals that satisfy the goal

<p>
</p></li><li> Analyze the input concepts to see if they match the actions
associated with the D-goals
</li></ul>

That's pretty much it.  Easy, huh?  Sure.  Just be glad you won't be
taking the semester-long version of this course.

<p>
</p><h2>Goal interactions</h2>

<p>
I didn't talk about many of these details in class, but here's more...
Stories don't often involve only the simple one-time goals and plans
of a single actor.  They usually contain a number of actors with a
number of goals and both intra-personal and inter-personal interactions
between those goals.  Here are four types of goal interactions that
understanders should be able to recognize:

</p><p>
<b>Goal subsumption</b>:  some goals are recurring goals.  That is, they
arise frequently and have some common precondition.   If an actor
plans ahead and acquires enough of something to satisfy the goal
preconditions for some extended period of time, this is called
goal subsumption.  For example, if you're mailing job applications, 
and every time you send a new one you wait in line at the post office to
buy a stamp, you wouldn't be doing goal subsumption.  If you went
to the post office one time and waited in line to buy a roll of
50 stamps, you would then have enough stamps to mail all your
job applications and not have to wait in line again.  That's 
goal subsumption.

</p><p>
<b>Goal conflict</b>:  this occurs when one actor has two or more goals 
that share a common resource, like time or money.  For example, 
if you want to buy a new G3 Mac and you also want to go 
to California to visit your family for summer vacation, but you 
only have enough money for one, that's goal conflict.  (sigh)

</p><p>
<b>Goal competition</b>:  when two or more people have conflicting goals.
For example, if you want to be with your family in California 
on Thanksgiving and your wife wants to be with her family in 
California on Thanksgiving, but the two families live hundreds
of miles apart, that's goal competition. (double sigh)

</p><p>
<b>Goal concord</b>:  when two or more actors share a goal, or when one
actor has a goal that he or she alone cannot achieve, but can be
achieved if other actors help, that's goal concord.  Think up
your own example.  Hmph.

</p><p>
</p><h2>Where are we now?</h2>

<p>
When we look at things like scripts, plans, and goals, we're looking
at specific examples of ways to try to organize memory into some collection
of "modules" or "packages" to aid in the understanding process.  Over
the past 20 or so years, there have been more and more efforts in the
realm of "memory-based understanding."  We've seen scripts, plans, and 
goals as organizing principles, but we've also seen other organizing
principles, that we won't go into here, and we've seen reasonably 
successful efforts to unify all this memory work into a single approach
to reasoning and understanding, which is often called case-based reasoning
(or case-based understanding, depending on the task).

</p><p>
In the case-based world, what's in memory is a collection of personal
experiences, ranging from the very specific to the very general, arranged
in what might be called a (very) tangled hierarchy.  In this world,
understanding becomes an issue of finding the parts of the input that
give you the right indices into memory.  Searching along these pointers
should get you some relevant cases which are applicable to what you're
trying to understand, or else they're close enough that you can adapt
them (i.e., modify them so that they're useful) to the current situation
and then use them to steer the understanding process.  And if the
attempt to understand input using the modified case is successful, you
can find an appropriate place in memory to put that modified cases and
tie it in with new indices.  Now you've modified or updated memory---you've
learned something!

</p><p>
</p><h2>Learning?!?!  I thought this was a language class!?</h2>

<p>
Over the years, the study of language understanding has followed a cycle
of question -&gt; answer -&gt; bigger question.  So when syntax-based approaches
arrived on the scene, people asked "What about the meaning?"  Then
semantics-based solutions were offered, and people asked "What about
inferences?  Stories?  Connective tissue?"  So various memory-based
approaches came about, and people asked "Where do the contents of memory
come from?  How is it organized?"

</p><p>
So language understanding folks now have to contemplate issues in
memory organization, knowledge acquisition/learning, and reasoning.
A viable attempt at a comprehensive model of language understanding
would somehow have to account for all of this.  (And this often
appears to be the initial goal of most new PhD students in language
understanding, and the bane of their advisors, at least until we
convince them to bite off a smaller, more doable chunk.)

So it's now clear to you, or at least it should be, that the art and
occasional science of natural language understanding by computer involves
more than just knowing your nouns from your verbs.  Language understanding
drags us into all sorts of problems in human cognition.  So, if you're
interested in exploring cognition, language, as we said at the beginning
of the quarter, is a great place to start that journey.  And if you're
just interested in hacking big systems, language is a great place for
that too.
