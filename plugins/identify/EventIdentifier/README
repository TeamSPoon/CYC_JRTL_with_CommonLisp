		Event IDENTIFIER

Introduction

The EventIdentifier is the plugin which invokes the Eventful 
service (http://eventful.com/) to retrieve events on the date 
and in the location specified in the user's query sent to 
the Urban LarKC Event workflow.
 


Prerequisites and dependencies

In order to work properly, the EventIdentifier requires a 
valid Eventful API key. 

To get the key, the user should register on the Eventful 
website. More detailed instructions can be found at 
http://api.eventful.com/keys.

To configure the EventIdentifier, the user then should:
- stop the LarKC platform (if running)
- open the "configuration.rdf" file located in the 
  "configuration-schema" folder
- insert the key obtained from the Eventful registration into
  the configuration file where indicated
- save the configuration file
- re-build the EventIdentifier project (if using Eclipse)
- re-start the LarKC platform
