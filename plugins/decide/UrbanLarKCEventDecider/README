		Urban LarKC Event DECIDER

Introduction

The workflow activated by this decider is able to 
retrieve the events happening in a given city on a given date.
The SPARQL query to get the desired results should be 
in the following form (events in Milan on July 2nd, 2010):

PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfcal: <http://www.w3.org/2002/12/cal/icaltzd#>
PREFIX addr: <http://schemas.talis.com/2005/address/schema#>
PREFIX geo: <http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#>
SELECT ?e ?s ?summary ?cat ?desc ?l ?lab ?lat ?lng
WHERE{
	?e rdf:type rdfcal:Vevent.
	?e rdfcal:summary ?summary.
	?e skos:subject ?cat.
	?e rdfcal:description ?desc.
	?e geo:location ?l.
	?l rdfs:label ?lab.
	?l geo:lat ?lat.
	?l geo:long ?lng.
	?e rdfcal:dtstart ?s .
	?l addr:localityName "Milan".
	FILTER(?s > xsd:dateTime("2010-07-02T00:00:00Z") 
		&& ?s < xsd:dateTime("2010-07-02T23:59:59Z")).
}

The user of this workflow can set both the name of the destination 
(which will be identified by LarKC by querying Geonames) and the 
date on which the events are sought.

The events are currently found on those listed by the well-known 
Web 2.0 service Eventful (http://eventful.com//).
 


Prerequisites and dependencies

In order to work properly, the Urban LarKC Event workflow needs the 
configuration of (at least) one of its plugins, namely the 
EventIdentifier, which requires a valid Eventful API key. 
Further instructions are given in the EventIdentifier README file.
